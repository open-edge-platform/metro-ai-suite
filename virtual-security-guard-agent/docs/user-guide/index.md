# Virtual Security Guard Agent

**Virtual Security Guard Agent (VSG)** is an operator console for **Argus**, an AI
security agent that runs on a **Hermes**
agent server. Argus searches recorded and live camera footage through Intel®
**Video Search and Summarization (VSS)**. Hermes cannot show video or images,
so VSG renders what Argus finds: match grids for human review, a floorplan
route, live camera matches, and PDF incident reports.

## Key Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Chat-driven search | Describe a person, attach a photo, or both. Argus calls `vss_search_video` and returns ranked sightings. |
| Human-in-the-loop review | A 3×2 grid of the top matches, up to 20 per search. The operator confirms; unconfirmed matches go back to Argus as false positives. |
| Crop and re-search | Crop the person from a clip frame; Argus searches again with that image. |
| Floorplan route | Confirmed sightings, in time order, are drawn camera-to-camera on an uploaded floorplan. |
| Live camera search | Only after operator consent: VSS watches live cameras and the console shows the 4 nearest live matches. |
| Incident reports | Argus drafts a report from confirmed sightings; the operator edits it and exports a PDF in the browser. |
| Grounded results | Grid clips come from the real VSS tool result, not from text the model typed. |
| Secure by default | One read-only, non-root nginx container with a route allowlist. The Hermes API key never reaches the browser. |

## Use Cases

- **Lost or missing person**: find where a person was last seen, from a photo
  or a description.
- **Incident follow-up**: reconstruct a subject's route and hand over a
  time-ordered PDF report.
- **Live watch**: after confirming a subject, watch live cameras for new
  sightings for a bounded time.
- **Privacy-aware search**: Argus describes clothing and movement only. It
  does not identify people or infer age, gender or ethnicity.
